A. LED Interfacing
B. Sensor Interfacing: connection pin out , 3 wire wire, 4 wire(4 th wire used for calbration readout , eg. laser sensor)
C. Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC): Architecture
D. Timer and Pulse Width Modulation (PWM): signal generation: vary speed(vary pwm signal on off time) 
E. Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter (UART):serial communication  port ( baud rate 1200/2400/4800/9600/../ 22400, start stop bit,data bit lendh, ctc;  rs232 to rs485/ rj45(ethernet communication) 
F. Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI): 2 wire communciation   masterslave 
G. Inter-Integrated Circuit (I2C): high speed update data: lcd disply, log data
H. Controller Area Network (CAN): vector gmbh  lead this communication  can is open source protocol:  ip  belong to bosch , 2 wire in,- max leanght of communication, end connection are terminated - 120ohm/60 ohm 
I. Local Interconnect Network (LIN): short distance / data format change
