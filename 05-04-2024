UART: Universal asynchronous receiver trnasmitter 
	1. h/w interface covered 
	synchornoous 
	
	RX -TX
	TX- RX
	CONNECT DB9 Pin connector m/f
	rj45 -ethernet communication
	rs232 - serial communication 
	
	 s/w programming 
	 
	 start bit 1 
	 stop bit 1
	 data bit  5
	 baud rate 9600/4800/2400/1200
	 
	 serial communication 
	 
	 SBUF : SERIAL BUFFER REGISTER 
	 SCON : SERIAL CONTROL REGISTER(SM0/SM1: BAAUD RATE FREQUENCY,SM2: ENBL MULTIPROCESSOR COMMUNICATION, REN: RX ENABLE,  TB8: 9TH tX BIT, RB8: 9 TH RECEIVE  BIT, TI: TX INTERRUPT FLAG, RI- RX INTERRUPT FLAG)
	 
	 PROGRAMMING: 
	 	1. CONFIGURE TIME IN AUTO RELOAD MODE
	 	2. TH1 = 0XFD;  9600
	 	3. LAOD SCON: MODE 1 ENABLE RECEPTION  (MODE 1 = 8 BIT UART WITH TIME 1 determined baud rate , please check serial mode specifier? 
	 	4. start timer1 by setting TR1 =1 check TIMER REGISTER?
	 	while (true)
	 	{
	 	5. lOAD  tx data in sbuf register 
	 	6. wait until loaded data is completerly t by polling ti flag 
	 	7. When the ti flag is set clear is and repeat from step 5 
	 	}
	 	
	 	
CAN : CONTROLLER AREA NETWORK 
	standar can = 11 bit 
	extended can = 29 bits 
	
	please go through n/w layer 
	
	can bus h/w connection: how multiple can protocol can be connected 
	for me share the link the electric vehicle: 
	
	share picctue of of ISO 11898 AND OSI ARCHITECTURE 
	
	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAN_bus : PLEAS GO THROUGH CAN BUS 
	
	:arbittrary bit, allow only one one to transmit data at a time
	
	recommend: pls go thru vector can bus video
